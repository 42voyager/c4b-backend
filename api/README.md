# C4B - Restful API

## About the project

This project served as a base for a Bank Loan Request App, in which the API could be able to receive Loan Requests,  send emails to customers and bank account owners, and finally generate contracts between the Bank and the customer.

We released it in case anyone wants use it as a boilerplate for a similar Restful API project in .net.

## Installation

Ubuntu was used to implement the project, so the .net SDK is required to be installed first. See Microsoft docs in this [link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu)

Then, once in the backend folder just run the following

```bash

```
